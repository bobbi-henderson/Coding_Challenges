# Coding Challenges
I'm going to be doing a a coding challenge every day! 
Most challenges will be sorced from codewars or leetcode.
For now, all of the challenges will be in javascript.

I'll push a new challenge every day. Think you can do better?
Commit your solution file into the appropriate folder with your name as the file name. 
If you have any questions on the daily challenge, feel free to reach out to anyone else working on it.

## Installation
Nothing to install! Just fork the repo and see all of the challenges I have completed. 
Each file is it's own challenge including the prompt and my solution.

Please, feel free to try and outdo me!

## Contribution
If you want to share your solutions feel free to submit a pull request by making a new branch called answer and pushing there.
Please note that no outside contributions will be merged into the main branch.
